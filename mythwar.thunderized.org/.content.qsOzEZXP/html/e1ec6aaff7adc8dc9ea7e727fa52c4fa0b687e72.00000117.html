  <h3>Prince Zenith</h3><b>Mage</b><br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Fire/Ice<br>
  <b>Mob</b><br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Fire/Ice<br>
  <b>Personal Note</b><br>
  This one is not really hard you can do it without any special armour, best to stun them and kill one by one. Drain and melee hits them good so that’s shouldn’t be problem. Mage gets heavy dmg from melee attacks. (Of course if you want this to be faster and easier you should have Equipment with some ice and fire ress. 50 of each one and this will be piece of cake)<br>
  <h3>Borg Giant</h3><b>Borg</b><br>
  <i>Skill:</i> none, melee only<br>
  <i>Other Notes:</i> Strong vs Melee / Weak vs Magic and hits 100-200k dmg but sometimes can hit even more<br>
  <b>Mob</b><br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Repel/Melee<br>
  <i>Other Notes:</i> Weak vs Fire<br>
  <b>Personal Note</b><br>
  This one could be problem. All of them totally resistant to melee, so no use, minions casts repel, so mages should be kamikazes to attack them, borg hits with 160k physical and minions capable to hit with 28k dmg (physical). Drain, magic (fire does very good dmg to front row) and poison have no obstacle to kill them. Cast repel if you want but if borg stands last and repel on, that who will get hit, will get and free tele too. You can make it without special eq, but i suggest at least 70+ melee resistance armour set, or high dodge set...<br>
  <h3>Dark Knight</h3><b>Male Human</b><br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Chaos IV<br>
  <i>Other Notes:</i> Weak vs Melee and can counter with 6k dmg<br>
  <b>Mob</b><br>
  7 Felsworms<br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Chaos II<br>
  2 Snake demons<br>
  <i>Skills:</i> none, uses melee<br>
  <i>Other Notes:</i> Weak vs Melee and can hit 1500 physical<br>
  <b>Personal Note</b><br>
  We fought long with this one, because all party was chaosed. <b>Mob</b>s werent a problem, but i and my GW were...this one can be soloed by str borg (not need to be full or half str, at least should hit 10k on capilla), i mean soloed without pet. <b>Mob</b>: 2 monsters attacks with 1500 dmg (on chars hits lower because they have better armor than pets), 7 monsters are very fast and casts chaos II all the time and knight casts chaos IV . Sometimes they can cast stun II but very rarely. If party gonna kill this one and has str borg, make sure that borg has really good chaos ress. All skills does good dmg on them.<br>
  <h3>Worn general</h3><b>Male Centaur</b><br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Drain IV<br>
  <i>Other Note:</i> Weak vs Melee, imune to chaos<br>
  <b>Mob</b><br>
  9 Aurora lions<br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Hypnotise<br>
  <i>Other Note:</i> Weak vs Melee and they can hit with 20k dmg<br>
  <b>Personal Note</b><br>
  All skill works on them, chaos lions and they will kill each other, melee works greatly (cent cant be chaosed). Good anti hypno set would be great if you don’t want to sleep during the fight.<br>
  <h3>Princess Agony</h3><b>Female Human</b><br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Frailty IV<br>
  <i>Other Note:</i> Strong vs Chaos/Stun/Hypno<br>
  <b>Mob</b><br>
  7 Skeletals:<br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Melee (about 70k dmg)<br>
  <i>Other Note:</i> Weak vs Stun/Hypno<br>
  2 Glimmer Fish:<br>
  <i>Skill:</i> Heal I (heals back 70k to skeles)<br>
  <i>Other Note:</i> Weak vs Stun/Hypno<br>
  <b>Personal Note</b><br>
  This one is hardest (my opinion), they stopped our victories ( free tele for everyone), but at least we killed that girl . <b>Mob</b>: princess (uses frailty IV and that was really effective, she cant be chaosed, stunned or hypnotised, at least all others spells works good), skeletals (can be stuned or hypnotised, not sure about chaos...All other spells works good. They hit with 60-70k physical) and 2 glimmer fishes (use heal I but that’s add back to skele 70k hp. Fishes can be stuned, not sure about chaos). Stun as many skeles as you can and keep stunned, then kill princess and fishes and then somehow skeles.<br>
